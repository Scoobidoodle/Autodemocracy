# Autodemocracy
Autodemocracy transparent voting platform for positive change in the world
So many disenfranchised voices across the world are screaming into thin air

I asked AI to generate some code... I'm a complete novice python dude - a sysadmin with some scripts borrowed and amended for AD and fileshare management and assistance.

The question I asked AI: 
I want an app that allows people to vote and make their opinions known on key issues and events. I want this primarily to be focused on international issues but also be scalable to allow for use at national, regional and local levels. I want there to be 2 tiers of users, unverified and verified. The verified users having checks conducted, possibly by trusted 3rd party organisations, to give an uncontrovertible and irrefutable validity to their vote. For each vote, I want there to be an education piece where users need to review evidence and facts both for and against the questions being asked, before being able to vote. There needs to be a community mechanism to allow review of evidenciary content to ensure it's as accurate and unbiased as possible before it gets published. I want users to be able to sign up for this using existing identities (google, microsoft, apple, other) and choose whether or not their votes are anonymous. I want there to be 700 moderators of international and national content with an active threshold requirement of 500. There needs to be a separate community space for these moderators to discuss content and manage the active membership with retirals and promotions of vetted and trusted users to moderator status. I want to be able to show the numbers of total votes but also break down votes by country and region to inform governments of the wishes of their populous.

The first issue voiced for vote being:

I demand my country takes immediate and urgent action to ensure and demand:
Israel withdraws troops, police and settlers from all occupied palestinian land
Israel dissolves the naval blockade of Gaza immediately and permanently
Israel opens it's hospitals, schools and universities to palestinian citizens under guard of UN peacekeeping forces

Key locations to start with are USA and UK to try and force change (maybe also Israel to show how many Israelis are against the genocide)

I have some old but pretty extensive designs for how I saw this operating and some of the required database design roughly drafted, but for now I want to keep it simple to get it running 

It might be too ambitious expanding for worldwide users to start with. There's a host of location specific challenges that would hamper project growth. Need a quick win whilst planning on greasing the wheels of the machine to operate internationally.
